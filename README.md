# mastermind

[Mastermind board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) implementation using OOP principles.

The game has many variations. I chose this version:
- 8 color options
- 4 holes
- 12 tries for guess
- duplicates and blanks are not allowed
- player is guesser, computer is codemaker

*<span style="font-size:10px;">I'm rather ashamed of this ugly code. Barely manage to make it work, scraped some features along the way, almost deleted the whole thing to start from scratch.But it SHOULD be here to remind me how bumpy will be the road if  you don't plan ahead =)</span>*
