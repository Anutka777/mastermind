[Mastermind board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) implementation using OOP principles.

The game has many variations. I chose this version:
- 8 color options
- 4 holes
- 12 tries for guess
- duplicates and blanks are not allowed
- player is guesser, computer is codemaker
